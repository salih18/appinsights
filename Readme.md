### Azure Application Insights Integration with Vue.js

This documentation covers how to enhance Azure Application Insights integration in a Vue.js application. Each section includes explanations and examples of how to track various types of telemetry data.

## 1. Track Page View

### Description
Tracks a page view with additional properties and measurements, providing detailed context about the page load and user interaction.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement detailed page view tracking with Azure Application Insights in a Vue.js component.

```js
appInsightsInstance.trackPageView({
    name: "DetailedTestPageView",
    properties: {
        pageCategory: "Test Category",
        isAuthenticated: true,
    },
    measurements: {
        loadTime: 2.5,
    },
    });
```

### Payload Example

```json
[
  {
    "time": "2024-06-12T14:35:46.372Z",
    "iKey": "bd48e824-c508-448b-a402-3b6ac4af96fb",
    "name": "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.bd48e824c508448ba4023b6ac4af96fb.Pageview",
    "tags": {
      "ai.user.id": "Vn+btkdGjHgyLGsDTZktMV",
      "ai.session.id": "Qp2xvAe+m2K8o/xcEmseja",
      "ai.device.id": "browser",
      "ai.device.type": "Browser",
      "ai.operation.name": "/",
      "ai.operation.id": "ad38bcbbc69c4791a4d3aee8a494e226",
      "ai.internal.sdkVersion": "javascript:3.2.1",
      "ai.internal.snippet": "-"
    },
    "data": {
      "baseType": "PageviewData",
      "baseData": {
        "ver": 2,
        "name": "DetailedTestPageView",
        "url": "http://192.168.40.104:8081/",
        "duration": "00:00:01.089",
        "properties": {
          "pageCategory": "Test Category",
          "isAuthenticated": "true",
          "refUri": "http://192.168.40.104:8081/"
        },
        "measurements": {
          "loadTime": 2.5
        },
        "id": "ad38bcbbc69c4791a4d3aee8a494e226"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Use Cases
1. **Detailed Page Tracking**: Track detailed information about page views, including custom properties and performance metrics.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track load times and other performance-related metrics to identify and optimize slow-loading pages.

### Example Use Case
A developer wants to track detailed page views to understand how different user segments or clients (e.g., authenticated users) interact with the application. By tracking the `loadTime`, they can identify performance bottlenecks and improve the user experience.

The properties like `pageCategory` and `isAuthenticated` provide additional context, helping the developer to segment and analyze the data more effectively.

## 2. Track Exception

### Description
Tracks an exception with additional properties such as severity level and the user action that caused the exception. This helps in monitoring and diagnosing issues in the application.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement exception tracking with Azure Application Insights in a Vue.js component.

```js
    appInsightsInstance.trackException({
      exception: new Error("Test Exception"),
      properties: {
        severityLevel: 3,
        userAction: "Testing",
      },
      measurements: {
        errorCount: 1,
      },
    });
```

### Use Cases
1. **Page Load Time Tracking**: Measure the load time of specific pages to analyze their performance.
2. **Custom Page Views**: Track custom page views with start and stop times, providing detailed insights into the page's lifecycle.
3. **Contextual Data**: Use properties to add context to the page views, making it easier to analyze and interpret the data.

### Example Use Case
A developer wants to track the load time of a specific page, such as the home page or a product page. By using the `startTrackPage` and `stopTrackPage` methods, they can measure the page load time and capture additional properties such as `pageCategory`. This information can help in identifying any delays or bottlenecks in the page load process and optimizing the page performance.

## 9. Flush Telemetry

### Description
Flushes any telemetry data that is currently buffered, ensuring it is sent to Azure Application Insights immediately.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement telemetry flushing with Azure Application Insights in a Vue.js component.

```js
    appInsightsInstance.flush();
```

### Use Cases
1. **Immediate Data Transmission**: Ensure that all buffered telemetry data is sent immediately, which is useful in scenarios where the application is shutting down or navigating away.
2. **Testing and Debugging**: Flush telemetry data to see immediate results during testing and debugging.

### Example Use Case
A developer wants to ensure that all telemetry data is sent before the user navigates away from the page. By calling the `flushTelemetry` method, they can ensure that no data is lost during the navigation.

## 10. Set User Context

### Description
Sets the authenticated user context for the telemetry data, associating all subsequent telemetry data with a specific user ID and account ID.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement setting the user context with Azure Application Insights in a Vue.js component.

```js
appInsightsInstance.setAuthenticatedUserContext("userId", "accountId");
```

### Use Cases
1. **User-Specific Telemetry**: Associate telemetry data with specific users to track user behavior and issues.
2. **User Authentication Tracking**: Track telemetry data in the context of authenticated users.

### Example Use Case
A developer wants to track user-specific behavior and issues. By setting the authenticated user context, they can associate telemetry data with specific user IDs and account IDs, making it easier to analyze user behavior and identify user-specific issues.

---

## 11. Clear User Context

### Description
Clears the authenticated user context, disassociating any subsequent telemetry data from the previously set user context.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement clearing the user context with Azure Application Insights in a Vue.js component.

```js
appInsightsInstance.clearAuthenticatedUserContext();
```

### Use Cases
1. **End User Session**: Clear user context when the user logs out or their session ends.
2. **Telemetry Data Separation**: Ensure that telemetry data from different users is not mixed by clearing the user context when necessary.

### Example Use Case
A developer wants to ensure that telemetry data is correctly separated between different user sessions. By clearing the user context when a user logs out, they can ensure that subsequent telemetry data is not associated with the previous user.

---

## 12. Add Telemetry Initializer

### Description
Adds a telemetry initializer to modify or add properties to all telemetry data before it is sent.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement adding a telemetry initializer with Azure Application Insights in a Vue.js component.

```js
    appInsightsInstance.addTelemetryInitializer((envelope) => {
      envelope.tags["ai.cloud.role"] = "Web";
    });
```

### Use Cases
1. **Custom Telemetry Properties**: Add or modify properties for all telemetry data to include custom context or metadata.
2. **Standardize Telemetry Data**: Ensure that certain properties are always included in all telemetry data for consistency.

### Example Use Case
A developer wants to ensure that all telemetry data includes a custom property indicating the cloud role. By adding a telemetry initializer, they can automatically add this property to all telemetry data before it is sent to Azure Application Insights.
